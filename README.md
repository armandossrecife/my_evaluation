# Evaluating the ATDCodeAnalyzer method

To evaluate the [ATDCodeAnalyzer](https://github.com/Technical-Debt-Large-Scale/atdcodeanalyzer), we executed the following steps:

1. **Development of an Inspection Labeling Process**: We created a process to label inspections, facilitating the identification of issues with potential architectural impacts.

2. **Analysis of Four Open-Source Repositories**: Employing the ATDCodeAnalyzer, we extracted critical classes from each repository and examined the behavior of critical classes and issues with architectural impact.
